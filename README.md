# Project-Management-Dashboard
This is a basic dashboard to track project status. It uses mysql for backend and python's tkinter module for frontend. The integration is done using matplotlib of python.
Here are some things to note before using the code:
Create a project database in your local mysql.
Create the tables in the databases (refer the screenshots uploaded).
Don't forget to change the password while connecting to mysql using pymysql. It is also important to note that you must have installed pymysql, tkinter, matplotlib and other important modules used in this.
Also, save the flag.png image in your local machine and change the location in your code.
Happy coding!
